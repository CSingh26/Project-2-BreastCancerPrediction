# Breast Cancer Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains Python code for breast cancer prediction and analysis. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning model implementation, and performance evaluation.

## Contents:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Handle missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Identify relevant features for breast cancer prediction. Create new features or transformations that might enhance the predictive model's performance.
3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for breast cancer prediction using various algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, etc.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements:
1. **Python** 3.12.x
2. **Libraries**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
